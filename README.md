# java-cli-gradle-crypto-gzip-compress-rsa-encrypted-scrypt-encoded

## Description
Encrypt password with RSA.
To compress the encrypted text gzip was used.

When storing a password it is best practice
to use a one-way hash such as bcrypt, scrypt,
or argon2.

There seems to be a weakness in scrypt;
pragmatically we verify a plaintext that
is encrypted with an established hash. The
straight-forward leads me to believe a rain-
bow table is very possible with this algorithm.
